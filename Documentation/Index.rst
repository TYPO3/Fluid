Fluid is a PHP template engine and is the de facto standard for any HTML-based
output in the TYPO3 CMS. However, it is not dependent on TYPO3 and can be used
in any PHP project.

If using Fluid in combination with TYPO3 CMS, a look at the documentation of
`Fluid Styled Content
 <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/typo3/cms-fluid-styled-content:start>`_
can be worth a look.
