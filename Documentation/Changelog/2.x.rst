  Migration path is to call the rendering context directly via
  :php:`TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\View\AbstractTemplateView::getRenderingContext()->getViewHelperVariableContainer()->setView()`
* Deprecation: Method :php:`TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\View\AbstractTemplateView::setCache()`
  has been marked as deprecated. It will be removed in Fluid v4.

* Deprecation: Method :php:`TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\View\AbstractTemplateView::getTemplatePaths()`
  has been marked as deprecated. It will be removed in Fluid v4.

* Deprecation: Method :php:`TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\AbstractViewHelper->overrideArgument()`
  has been marked as deprecated. It will log a deprecation level error message when called in
  Fluid v4. It will be removed in Fluid v5.
  :php:`TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\AbstractViewHelper->registerArgument()` now no longer throws
  an exception if an argument is already defined, so calls to
  :php:`TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\AbstractViewHelper->overrideArgument()`
  can be replaced with :php:`TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\AbstractViewHelper->registerArgument()`.

  has been marked as deprecated. It will log a deprecation level error message when called in
  Fluid v4. It will be removed in Fluid v5.
  Arbitrary tags are automatically added by :php:`AbstractTagBasedViewHelper`, single ViewHelpers

  is removed.
