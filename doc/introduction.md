# Introduction
The most important fact you must know about **Fluid Powered TYPO3** is: 
Fluid Powered TYPO3 is based on established conventions coming from Extbase and Fluid, as well as TYPO3 CMS itself. 
The purpose of Fluid Powered TYPO3 extensions is _integration facilitation_. To illustrate this we can look at a page template written in Fluid - without the integration facilitation from rendering a Fluid template as page template requires setting up a special TypoScript configuration and mapping (just an example) the backend or frontend layout selector field values to template files which can be rendered.But with the integration facilitation from , using said page template becomes a simple matter of placing it in a directory and adding this directory to the collection.



Fluid Powered TYPO3 enhances _integration facilities_, and is based on established conventions coming from Extbase and fluid. 
Rendering a Fluid template as page template requires setting up a special TypoScript configuration and mapping 
(just an example) the backend or frontend layout selector field values to template files which can be rendered. 
Configuraion over convention is the main difference between this approach and the (in TYPO3 CMS) perdominant approach, is that instead of expecting a large configuration, Fluid Powered TYPO3 will instead expect a minimal configuration of paths rather than complete structure, andthen detect and use templates in this path.
