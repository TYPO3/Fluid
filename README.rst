======================
Fluid Rendering Engine
======================

Fluid is a PHP template engine and is the de facto standard for any HTML-based
output in the TYPO3 CMS. However, it is not dependent on TYPO3 and can be used
in any PHP project.

For a more detailed guide to TYPO3 content elements based on Fluid, see
`TYPO3 Content Elements based on Fluid <https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-fluid-styled-content/main/en-us/Index.html>`__.
