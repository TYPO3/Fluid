/**
 * EXAMPLE: Static string caching of template code
 *
 * This example shows how to force a chunk of template
 * code to be compiled not as a set of converted nodes
 * but as a static string, resulting in that string
 * being directly output when the compiled template is
 * rendered. Doing this also prevents arguments and child
 * nodes from being compiled and is the best possible
 * performance for template code that does not depend on
 * dynamic variables (e.g. always produce the same output).
