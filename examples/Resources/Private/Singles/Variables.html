A string with numbers in it: {types.aStringWithNumbers as integer}
Ditto, with type name stored in variable: {types.aStringWithNumbers as types.typeNameInteger}
A comma-separated value iterated as array:
<f:for each="{types.csv as array}" as="arrayMember">	- {arrayMember}
</f:for>
<!-- Dynamic string: changing "dynamic1" to "dynamic2" reads other string -->
String variable name with dynamic1 part: {stringwith{dynamic1}part}.
String variable name with dynamic2 part: {stringwith{dynamic2}part}.

<!-- Dynamic array: changing "dynanic1" to "dynamic2" reads other array member -->
Array member in $array[$dynamic1]: {array.{dynamic1}}
Array member in $array[$dynamic2]: {array.{dynamic2}}
